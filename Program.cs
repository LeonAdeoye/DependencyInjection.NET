// The way you add one or multiple IHostedServices into your WebHost or Host is by registering them up through the AddHostedService extension method.
// Since .NET Core 2.0, the framework provides a new interface named IHostedService helping you to easily implement hosted services.
// The basic idea is that you can register multiple background tasks (hosted services) that run in the background while your host is running.

// The IHostedService background task execution is coordinated with the lifetime of the application (host or micro-service).
// You register tasks when the application starts and you have the opportunity to do some graceful action or clean-up when the application is shutting down.

// Without using IHostedService, you could always start a background thread to run any task.
// The difference is precisely at the app's shutdown time when that thread would simply be killed without having the opportunity to run graceful clean-up actions.
